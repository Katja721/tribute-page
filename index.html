    <div id="tribute-info">The peregrine falcon (Falco peregrinus), also known as the peregrine, and historically as the duck hawk in North America, 
        is a cosmopolitan bird of prey (raptor) in the family Falconidae. 
        A large, crow-sized falcon, it has a blue-grey back, barred white underparts, and a black head. 
        The peregrine is renowned for its speed, reaching over 320 km/h (200 mph) during its characteristic hunting stoop (high-speed dive),
         making it the fastest bird in the world, as well as the fastest member of the animal kingdom. 
         According to a National Geographic TV program, the highest measured speed of a peregrine falcon is 389 km/h (242 mph).
          As is typical for bird-eating raptors, peregrine falcons are sexually dimorphic, with females being considerably larger than males.
          
        The peregrine's breeding range includes land regions from the Arctic tundra to the tropics. 

        It can be found nearly everywhere on Earth, except extreme polar regions, very high mountains, and most tropical rainforests; 
        the only major ice-free landmass from which it is entirely absent is New Zealand. 
        This makes it the world's most widespread raptor, and one of the most widely found bird species. 
        In fact, the only land-based bird species found over a larger geographic area is not always naturally occurring, but one widely introduced by humans, 
        the rock pigeon, which in turn now supports many peregrine populations as a prey species. 
        The peregrine is a highly successful example of urban wildlife in much of its range, taking advantage of tall buildings as nest sites and an abundance of prey such as pigeons and ducks. 
        Both the English and scientific names of this species mean "wandering falcon," referring to the migratory habits of many northern populations. 
        Experts recognize 17 to 19 subspecies, which vary in appearance and range; disagreement exists over whether the distinctive Barbary falcon is represented by two subspecies of Falco peregrinus, or is a separate species, 
        F. pelegrinoides. The two species' divergence is relatively recent, during the time of the last ice age, therefore the genetic differential between them (and also the difference in their appearance) 
        is relatively tiny. They are only about 0.6–0.8% genetically differentiated.
        
        Although its diet consists almost exclusively of medium-sized birds, the peregrine will sometimes hunt small mammals, small reptiles, or even insects. Reaching sexual maturity at one year, it mates for life and nests in a scrape, normally on cliff edges or, in recent times, on tall human-made structures. 
        The peregrine falcon became an endangered species in many areas because of the widespread use of certain pesticides, especially DDT. 
        Since the ban on DDT from the early 1970s, populations have recovered, supported by large-scale protection of nesting places and releases to the wild.
        
        The peregrine falcon is a well-respected falconry bird due to its strong hunting ability, high trainability, versatility, and availability via captive breeding. It is effective on most game bird species, from small to large. It has also been used as a religious, royal, or national symbol across multiple eras and areas of human civilization. 
    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>The peregrine falcon has a body length of 34 to 58 cm (13–23 in) and a wingspan from 74 to 120 cm (29–47 in).
        The male and female have similar markings and plumage, but as in many birds of prey the perehimgrine falcon displays marked sexual dimorphism in size, with the female measuring up to 30% larger than the male.
         Males weigh 330 to 1,000 g (0.73–2.20 lb) and the noticeably larger females weigh 700 to 1,500 g (1.5–3.3 lb). 
         In most subspecies, males weigh less than 700 g (1.5 lb) and females weigh more than 800 g (1.8 lb), with cases of females weighing about 50% more than their male breeding mates not uncommon. 
         The standard linear measurements of peregrines are: the wing chord measures 26.5 to 39 cm (10.4–15.4 in), the tail measures 13 to 19 cm (5.1–7.5 in) and the tarsus measures 4.5 to 5.6 cm (1.8–2.2 in).<br />

        The back and the long pointed wings of the adult are usually bluish black to slate grey with indistinct darker barring (see "Subspecies" below); the wingtips are black. 
        The white to rusty underparts are barred with thin clean bands of dark brown or black. 
        The tail, coloured like the back but with thin clean bars, is long, narrow, and rounded at the end with a black tip and a white band at the very end. 
        The top of the head and a "moustache" along the cheeks are black, contrasting sharply with the pale sides of the neck and white throat. 
        The cere is yellow, as are the feet, and the beak and claws are black. 
        The upper beak is notched near the tip, an adaptation which enables falcons to kill prey by severing the spinal column at the neck. 
        The immature bird is much browner with streaked, rather than barred, underparts, and has a pale bluish cere and orbital ring.
        
        A study shows that their black Malar Stripe exists to reduce glare from solar radiation, allowing them to see better. 
        Photos from The Macaulay Library and iNaturalist showed that the malar stripe is thicker where there is more solar radiation. 
        This supports the Solar Glare Hypothesis. </p>
